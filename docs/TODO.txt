* Show tree doesn't seem to work when you switch sources (using the builtin
  example, if you switch to the second source)

* When in tree, if you click "select" we should probably close down the
  overlay, or atleast one should be able to configure the behaviour

* Sometimes leaf elements are wrongly presented with a triangle: when you try
  to open it, disappears
